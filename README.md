## Abstract

*Include your abstract here. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept, method, and results. This should tell us what architecture/approach you used. Also describe your creative goals, and whether you were successful in achieving them. Also could describe future directions.*

In this project, I wanted to create improvisation or a better piece for the piece of piano music. The piece could be unfinished or finished but doesn’t have a complex chord (A simple piano piece). The goal of this project is to learn how to generate the pieces by using RNN performance or an LSTM recurrent neural network. The way I will approach this is that first, I have to reconstruct the original pieces using the Garageband software instrument, in the form of magenta. In this process, I will have to arrange those notes accordingly. For the RNN component of the project, I plan to generate the continuation or the accompaniment of those musical pieces. Few examples of the pieces were Antonin Dvorak and the others were the piece written by Schubert called ‘unfinished symphony’. The pieces can be change in the future depending on the experiment.
